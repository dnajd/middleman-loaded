## Bower

Bower is not needed as all vendor packages are in /source/assets/vendor.  We have left the .bowerrc and bower.json as documentation of what packages & versions were included in middleman-loaded. You can use bower if you wish to pull packages into /vendor/bower and upgrade.

# TODO

A few other useful list classes

* .list-of-links makes anchors inside list items more clickable
* And .list-of-links-horiz is self explanatory
* switch out mfglabs-iconset with [fontawesome](https://github.com/cristianferrarig/font-awesome-middleman
1 min) and update docs
